Significant Program Proposal

(This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best knowledge
at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the beginning to the
end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and some of the ideas we
proposed change. This is part of completing any project and is fine.
However, we still must write a proposal so that our teachers or
supervisors know what we intend to do. Please answer each of the
following questions to the best of your knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?

Alarm_Metrics

2. What real world problem will your program address or help to solve?

Creating a program to track metrics for a company alarm response data 
This will be a specific use program for a hypothetical company based on previous work metrics 

We will be demonstrating this with a large csv file with varied data the the user can use to filter data to find trends.

The previous program that Benjamin used in order to audit this data took several hours to compile the audits and parse through the data. We want to recreate this program and have it run in a fraction of the time.

 

3. What will you learn from developing this program?

How to more effectively use pandas and matplotlib. Both are areas we have struggled with and would like to turn into a strength instead of a weakness.
Additionally, we will be working on this as a team to simulate a real world working relationship to help facilitate working as a team.

4. What Python modules will your program use? (Some examples are: csv,
datetime, functools, matplotlib, math, pandas, pytest, random, requests,
and tkinter.)

pandas, pytest, matplotlib

5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?

We intend to write a program with multiple functions

6. Will you write test functions to test many of your program functions?

Yes
